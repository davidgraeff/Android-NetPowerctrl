        explanation="Using `showAsAction=&quot;always&quot;` in menu XML, or `MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_ALWAYS` in Java code is usually a deviation from the user interface style guide.Use `ifRoom` or the corresponding `MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_IF_ROOM` instead.

If `always` is used sparingly there are usually no problems and behavior is roughly equivalent to `ifRoom` but with preference over other `ifRoom` items. Using it more than twice in the same menu is a bad idea.

This check looks for menu XML files that contain more than two `always` actions, or some `always` actions and no `ifRoom` actions. In Java code, it looks for projects that contain references to `MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_ALWAYS` and no references to `MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_IF_ROOM`."
