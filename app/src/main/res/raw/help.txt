<h3>Exchange/Backup device configuration</h3>
<p>Your devices configuration is automatically backed up by the Google app-data Backup Service.
If you uninstall and reinstall the application, your configuration should be restored.
At the moment there is no way to manually save and restore configurations.</p>

<h3>Exchange configurations and scenes with other devices</h3>
<p>If you would like to transfer your configuration to another device (for instance from a
mobile to a tablet, or from your phone to a friend's one) and both devices have NFC capability,
then do the following:
<ol>
<li>Unlock both devices</li>
<li>Enable NFC on both</li>
<li>Hold them together</li>
</ol>
Android now want you to confirm to use the <i>beam</i> functionality.
If this App is not installed on the destination device, Google Play will be started.
If you confirm <i>beam</i>, the destination device will ask you which configurations should be transferred.</p>
