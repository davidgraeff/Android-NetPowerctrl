<h2>NET-PwrCtrl Help</h2>
If you are using this app for the first time, take a moment
and read this introduction text. We begin with
configuring a NET-PwrCtrl device, go on with an explanation
of the outlet list view and after that we show you how to
create <i>scenes</i> to switch
a group of outlets at the same time with only a single action.
Scenes can be stored on your favorite launcher as an icon.
This tutorial ends with some information about how to
exchange NET-PwrCtrl device configurations between android
mobiles and tablets and configuration backups.

<h3>Navigation</h3>
Move your finger to the left screen edge and swipe to the right to see
the navigation menu. Actions, specific to one of the screen, reachable from there,
are listed in the top right corner next to the title.

<h3>Configuration</h3>
<blockquote>Move your finger to the left screen edge and swipe to the right to see
the navigation menu. Choose <b>"Add new device"</b>.</blockquote>

<h3>Switching outlets</h3>
<blockquote>Move your finger to the left screen edge and swipe to the right to see
the navigation menu. Choose <b>"Outlet list"</b>.</blockquote>
If you use a mobile, you see a list of all outlets from all configured devices. If you use
a tablet you will see a grid of those outlets. If you click on one of them, its state will be toggled
immediately.

<h3>Scenes and launcher shortcuts</h3>
<blockquote>Move your finger to the left screen edge and swipe to the right to see
the navigation menu. Choose <b>"Scenes"</b>.</blockquote>
<p>To create a scene, click on the plus icon of the action area. In the following screen, you may
choose an action for each outlet. An action is on of these: Switch on, off, toggle.
Additionally you may name the scene now. You can always rename a scene from the list of scenes, by
making a long tap on a scene's name.</p>

<p>
To create a launcher shortcut the actual operation depends on your launcher. Usually you long press
on a free space of your launcher and choose the "Shortcut" menu entry. A list pops up with all applications
which support shortcuts. Select this app. From here on it is the same procedure as with creating a scene.

<h3>Exchange/Backup device configuration</h3>
<p>Your devices configuration is automatically backed up by the Google app-data Backup Service.
If you uninstall and reinstall the application, your configuration should be restored.
At the moment there is no way to manually save and restore configurations.</p>

<p>If you would like to transfer your configuration to another device (for instance from a
mobile to a tablet, or from your phone to a friend's one) and both devices have NFC capability,
then do the following:
<ol>
<li>Unlock both devices</li>
<li>Enable NFC on both</li>
<li>Hold them together</li>
</ol>
Android now want you to confirm to use the <i>beam</i> functionality.
If this App is not installed on the destination device, Google Play will be started.
If you confirm <i>beam</i>, the destination device will ask you which configurations should be transferred.</p>
